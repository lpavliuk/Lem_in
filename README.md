# Lem_in

There is an ant farm, with tunnels and rooms; we place the ants on one side; and we look at how they find the exit.



Program __lem-in__ helps ants to find the exit.

The goal of this program is to find the quickest way to get n ants across the farm.



File for __lem-in__ must consists of:

- number of ants;

- the rooms (which are defined by: name coord_x coord_y);

- the links (which are defined by: name1-name2);

At the beginning of the game, all the ants are in the room ##start. 
The goal is to bring them to the room ##end with as few turns as possible. 
Each room can only contain one ant at a time. (except at ##start and ##end which can contain as many ants as necessary.)
